## Introduction
My journey in technology began as a Desktop Analyst, where I spent two years honing my skills in IT support, troubleshooting, and system maintenance. This role allowed me to build a solid technical foundation and develop problem-solving abilities, which became instrumental in my transition into cybersecurity. For the past year, I have worked as a Cybersecurity Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC), gaining hands-on experience in monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. I hold an associate degree in cybersecurity from Palomar College and earned the CompTIA Security+ certification to strengthen my expertise.

## Objective

I am excited to continue advancing in the field, with a strong focus on transitioning into cloud security to help organizations secure their cloud environments and infrastructure.
